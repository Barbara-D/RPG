- a branch named after a feature when working on something specific


git checkout -b development
- create a new branch named "development" and switch into it

git checkout main
- switch back to main branch

git branch -d development
- delete the development branch

git branch
-show all local branches of the repository

git add *
-propose changes

git commit -m "commit message"
-committed to HEAD but not in remote yet

git push origin development

git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
