-----------GIT--------------

- create a development branch to be worked on, then merge into main regularly (when something is done)
- a branch named after a feature when working on something specific


git checkout -b development
- create a new branch named "development" and switch into it

git checkout main
- switch back to main branch

git branch -d development
- delete the development branch


git add *
-propose changes

git commit -m "commit message"
-committed to HEAD but not in remote yet

git push origin main
-send changes to remote repository (in this case main branch)

git checkout -- filename
- replaces local changes with last content in HEAD (so from commit)

git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
- drop all local changes and commits
